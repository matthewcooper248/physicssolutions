			<h3>
				problem
			</h3>
			<p>
				A block of mass \(m_1\) sits on an inclined plane with an angle of \(\theta\) to the ground.
				The coefficient of friction between \(m_1\) and the plane is \(\mu_k\).
				Mass \(m_1\) has a massless, dimensionless string attached to one end.
				The string is run over a massless pulley and the other end of the string is attached to a hanging block of mass, \(m_2\).
				Mass \(m_1\) is sliding down the inclined plane.
				Find the acceleration of the masses. See the setup of the problem below.

				solution
			</h3>
			<p>
				First, we will draw a free body diagram of all the forces on \(m_1\).
				Two make the math easier, we are going to rotate our cartesian coordinates
				so that most of the forces are either along the x or y-axes.
				We choose the positive x-direction to point down the slope of the inclined plane.
				The positive y-axis is pointing normal to the surface of the inclined plane.
				The forces on mass \(m_1\) are the force of gravity, \(m_1g\), pointing straight down,
				the normal force pointing in the positve y direction,
				the force of friction, \(\mu_kN\), pointing in the negative x direction,
				and the force of tension pointing in the negative x direction.
				Here is what the free body diagram for mass \(m_1\) should look like.

				All of our forces are along either the x or y-axes except the force of gravity, \(m_1g\).
				We need to decompose it into two component forces, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.
				The angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal is \(\theta\).
				In the figure above, I have shown the horizontal going through the center of the box mass.
				The angle between the horizontal and the x-axis—which is along the inclined plane—is also \(\theta\).
				The negative x-axis and the negative y-axis form a 90° angle.
				Therefore, the angle between the horizontal and the negative y-axis is \(90°-\theta\).
				Then we can say that the angle between \(m_1g\)—which is the vertical—and the negative y-axis must be \(\theta\).
				Now we can use trigonometry to determine the projections of the force of gravity on to the-x axis and y-axis.
				The x componenet is \(m_1g\mathrm{sin}\theta\) along the positive x-axis.
				The y component is \(m_1g\mathrm{cos}\theta\) along the negative y-axis.
				These are depicted in the figure below.

			<p>
				Now we can apply Newton's second law in the x and y directions.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\Sigma F_x=m_1a=m_1g\mathrm{sin}\theta-\mu_kN-T\tag{1}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\Sigma F_y=0=N-m_1g\mathrm{cos}\theta\tag{2}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				From equation 2, we can already determine the normal force which is one of our unknowns.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}N=m_1g\mathrm{cos}\theta\tag{3}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's create a free body diagram of \(m_2\).
				The forces on \(m_2\) are the tension, \(T\), and the force of gravity, \(m_2\).
				Both are along the y-axis as depicted below.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we can apply Newton's second law in the x and y directions.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\Sigma F_x=0=0\tag{4}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\Sigma F_y=m_2a=T-m_2g\tag{5}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now I recommend using equation 5 to isolate \(T\) which is an unknown variable we will need to eliminate.
				We will get \(T\) in terms of the acceleration, \(a\), which is what we are ultimately trying to find.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}T=m_2a+m_2g\tag{6}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now plug equations 3 and 6 into equation 1 to get the following.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}m_1a=m_1g\mathrm{sin}\theta-\mu_km_1g\mathrm{cos}\theta-m_2a-m_2g\tag{7}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll do a few steps of algebraic manipulation before finally isolating, \(a\), and having our final answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}m_1a+m_2a=m_1g\mathrm{sin}\theta-\mu_km_1g\mathrm{cos}\theta-m_2g\tag{8}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}a\left(m_1+m_2\right)=m_1g\left(\mathrm{sin}\theta-\mu_k\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)-m_2g\tag{9}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}a=\frac{m_1g\left(\mathrm{sin}\theta-\mu_k\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)-m_2g}{m_1+m_2}\tag{10}\end{equation}
