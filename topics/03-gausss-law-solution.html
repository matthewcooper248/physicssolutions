				solution
			</h3>
			<p>
				To solve this problem, the most important equation is Gauss's law.
				Gauss's law is the following.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\tag{1}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				\(\vec{E}\) is the electric field vector due to a charge distribution
				within a guassian surface of of area \(A\).
				\(d\vec{A}\) is an infinitesimal element of the surface area of the gaussian surface.
				\(q_{enc}\) is the amount of charge enclosed in the gaussian surface.
				\(\epsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space.
				This is an integral equation.
				But this problem doesn't require a lot of advanced math to solve.
				To demonstrate this let's calculate the electric field in region \(I\).
				We will take a lot of advantage of the spherical symmetry of this problem.
				Let's use a spherical coordinate system that starts at the center of the concentric spheres.
				Any point where we want to calculate the electric field is described by a vector, \(\vec{r}\),
				that is a distance \(r\) from the center of the coordinate system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's calculate the electric field in region \(I\).
				Region \(I\) is where \(r\) is less than \(a\).
				The electric field produced by a point or spherical charge points outward in all directions.
				This means that the electric field is always perpendicular to a spherical gaussian surface
				that encompasses the charge distribution.
				As a result, the dot product of the electric field and the surface area element, \(\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}\),
				is the magnitude of the electric field at that point, \(E\),
				multiplied the size of the surface area element at that point, \(dA\).
				As a result of this, the left hand side of equation 1 becomes
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=E\oint dA\tag{2}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				When using Gauss's law, you should choose a gaussian surface
				where the surface area can be easily calculated.
				That way the integral on the left hand side of equation 2 can be easily evaluated.
				Throughout this entire solution,
				the gaussian surface will always be a sphere.
				\(\oint dA\) will always equal the surface area of the sphere of radius \(r\) which is \(4\pi r^2\).
			</p>
			<p>
				In electrostatic equilibrium,
				the charge on a conductor always resides on the surface.
				So the \(3Q\) on the inner spere is all located on its surface.
				In region \(I\),
				there is no charge enclosed since \(r&lt;a\), so \(q_{enc}=0\). 
				Using Gauss's law we have
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\tag{1}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E4\pi r^2=\frac{0}{\epsilon_0}\tag{3}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E=0,~r&lt;a\tag{4}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				in region \(I\).
			</p>
			<p>
				In region \(II\), all of the charge on the inner sphere is enclosed so \(q_{enc}=3Q\).
				\(r\) is the distance from the center of the concentric spheres.
				Our answer for the electric field will be in terms of this radius, \(r\).
				We can use Gauss's law in the following way.				
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\tag{5}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E4\pi r^2=\frac{3Q}{\epsilon_0}\tag{5}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E=\frac{3Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2}\tag{6}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E=\frac{3Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2},~a&lt;r&lt;b\tag{7}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				That is the electric field in region \(II\).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's calculate the electric field in region \(III\).
				An important principle to remember
				is that the electric field inside a conductor is always zero.
				So we don't even need to touch Guass's law at the moment in this region.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\tag{8}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E=0,~b&lt;r&lt;c\tag{9}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's calculate the electric field in the final region, region \(IV\).
				The charge enclosed,
				is the sum of the charges in both the sphere and the sperical shell.
				So \(q_{enc}=3Q-2Q=Q\).
				Let's use Gauss's law in region \(IV\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\tag{10}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E4\pi r^2=\frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}\tag{11}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}E=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2},~c&lt;r\tag{12}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now our final task is to determine the charge distribution on the outer shell in electrostatic equilibrium.
				From earlier we know that the electric field in the inside of the shell is zero.
				Gauss's law says that that the electric field within a surface
				is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface.
				If the electric field at a radius inside the spherical shell is zero,
				that must mean that the charge enclosed is zero.
				We know that there is \(3Q\) of charge on the inner sphere.
				We also know that the charge on a conductor resides entirely on the surfaces.
				The charge on the outer shell may reside on its outer surface and its inner surface.
				Its inner surface has a radius of \(b\), in our chosen spherical coordinate system.
				Let's call the charge on the inner surface, \(Q_b\).
				Then we can make the following statements.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}q_{enc}=0=3Q+Q_b\tag{13}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}Q_{b}=-3Q\tag{14}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				We know that the total charge on the outer spherical shell is \(-2Q\).
				we also know that the charge on its inner surface is \(-3Q\).
				The charge on its inner surface, \(Q_{b}\), must be the difference between
				its total charge, \(Q_{shell}\), and the charge on it's outer surface, \(Q_{c}\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}Q_c=Q_{shell}-Q_{b}\tag{15}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}Q_C=-2Q-3Q=Q\tag{16}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				So the charge on the outside of the spherical shell is \(Q\).
				The charge distribution on the outer shell is \(-3Q\) on the inner surface
				and \(Q\) on the outer surface.
				This adds up to a total charge of \(-2Q\) on the outer shell
				which is consistent with an inner charge of \(-3Q\) and an outer charge of \(Q\).
				So we have answered the question of what is the charge distribution on the shell
				when the system is in electrostatic equilibrium.
				There is a \(-3Q\) charge on the inner surface at \(r=b\)
				and there is \(Q\) charge on the outer surface at \(r=c\).
