			<p>
				A ball of mass \(m\) is attached to a massless, dimensionless string of length \(L\)
				that is attached to the ceiling.
				The ball is held back so that the string makes an angle of \(\theta\) with the vertical
				and then it is released.
				What is the speed of the ball and the tension in the string when the ball reaches the lowest
				point of its swing?

			<p>
				First, we will calculate the speed of the ball when it reaches the lowest point of its motion.
				We will use conservation of energy to do this.
				The total energy of the ball right after it is released with the pendulum at an angle \(\theta\)
				should be equal to the total energy of the ball when it is at the lowest point of its motion.
				We will call the former \(E_i\) and the latter \(E_f\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}E_i=E_f\tag{1}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				In this problem, the energy only takes two forms.
				The ball has gravitational potential energy, \(U\), and kinetic energy of motion, \(T\).
				We will use the subscripts \(i\) and \(f\) on these as well to denote their initial and final quantities.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}U_i+T_i=U_f+T_f\tag{2}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				The kinetic energy is determined by the mass, \(m\), and speed, \(v\), according to
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}T=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\tag{3}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Gravitational potential energy is determined by
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}U=mgh\tag{4}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(m\) is the mass of the object, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity,
				and \(h\) is the displacement of the object from the point of zero potential energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can rewrite equation 2 like so.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}mgh_i+\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2=mgh_f+\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2\tag{5}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				The gravitational potential energy is defined relative to a vertical reference point of your choosing.
				We can simplify our work by setting the reference point at the vertical location of either the initial or final location of the ball.
				Let's set the point of zero gravitational potential energy to be the vertical location of the ball's initial position.
				That means \(h_i=0\).
				Also, the ball is instantaneously at rest when it is released so \(v_i=0\).
			<p>
				We need to determine the vertical displacement of the ball from its initial position
				when it is at the bottom of its motion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take a look at these additions to the diagram of our setup and then we will discuss it.

			<p>
				When the ball is at its lowest point, the distance between the ball and the ceiling
				is just the length of the string, \(L\).
				What was the original distance of the ball from the ceiling when it was pulled back at an angle \(\theta\)?
				It is the projection of the length of the string \(L\) at an angle \(\theta\)
				on to the vertical, which is \(L\mathrm{cos}\theta\).
				Then the vertical distance between the balls original position and its position at the bottom of its motion
				is the ball's original vertical drop subtracted from the length of the string, \(L-L\mathrm{cos}\theta\).
				This is the change in height that we need to plug in so \(h_f=-\left(L-L\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\).
				I put a minus sign in front of the length we calculated because this is a displacement
				from a higher gravitational potential energy to a lower one.
				We are trying to find the final velocity so let's just call it \(v\) and let \(v_f=v\).
				Now we can rewrite equation 5 as
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}mg(0)+\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2=mg\left[-\left(L-L\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\right]+\frac{1}{2}mv^2\tag{6}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we can do some algebra to isolate, \(v\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\frac{1}{2}mv^2=mgL\left(1-\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\tag{7}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}v^2=2gL\left(1-\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\tag{8}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}v=\sqrt{2gL\left(1-\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)}\tag{9}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Next let's determine the tension, \(T\), in the string when the ball is at its lowest point.
				If we look at our earlier diagram, we see that there are only two forces acting on the ball,
				\(T\) and \(mg\).
				We need to use Newton's second law.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\Sigma F=ma\tag{10}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				T is in the vertical direction so we only need to sum the force in the vertical direction.
				But a mass swinging as a pendulum is actually circular motion.
				When the ball is at its lowest point,
				the vertical direction is the radial direction.
				So we will sum the forces in the radial direction.
				Pointing towards the pivot point will be the positive direction.
				Is there any acceleration in the radial direction?
				Yes. The acceleration inward in the radial direction depends on the tangential speed, \(v\), of the ball
				which we have conveniently just calculated.
				It also depends on the distance from the center of the circular motion, \(r\).
				Here is the equation.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}a=\frac{v^2}{r}\tag{11}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's use these pieces of information in Newton's second law
				and see if we can determine, \(T\), in terms of our unknowns.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\Sigma F=ma\tag{12}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}T-mg=m\frac{v^2}{L}\tag{13}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}T=mg+m\frac{v^2}{L}\tag{14}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}T=mg+\frac{m}{L}\left[\sqrt{2gL\left(1-\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)}\right]^2\tag{15}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}T=mg+2mg\left(1-\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\tag{16}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}T=mg\left(3-2\mathrm{cos}\theta\right)\tag{17}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				And that is the tension in the string.
