				solution
			</h3>
			<p>
				The two main principles that you'll need to use to solve this problem are
				Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's loop rule.
				Ohm's law is given by the following equation.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V=IR\tag{1}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				\(V\) is the voltage across a circuit element with a resistance \(R\).
				\(I\) is the current in that section of the circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kirchhoff's loop rule states that the voltage across any closed loop is zero.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the diagram above, the direction of the currents is shown for you.
				However, those may not actually be the correct directions for the flows of currents.
				That's okay for now, though.
				We will assume these are the correct directions and calculate the magnitudes of the current.
				If we get a negative answer for the magnitude of the current
				then we know the current actually goes in the opposite direction of what is shown in the above diagram.
				We see that \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) combine to form \(I_3\) at point \(III\).
				We can state the following.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I_1+I_2=I_3\tag{2}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, we will apply Kirchoff's loop rule and utilize Ohm's law along the way.
				We are going to add up all the voltages in a loop that goes from
				point \(I\), to point \(II\), to point \(III\), to point \(IV\), and back to point \(I\).
				The sum of all the voltages should be zero.
				From point \(I\) to point \(II\), the voltage doesn't change.
				From point \(II\) to point \(III\), the voltage increases by \(\mathrm{5V}\),
				then decreases by \(\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1\) according to Ohm's law.
				From point \(III\) to point \(IV\), the voltage doesn't change.
				Finally from point \(IV\) to point \(I\),
				the voltage decreases by \(\left(1~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_3\).
				We can state the following.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}5~\mathrm{V}-\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-\left(1~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_3=0\tag{3}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's do the same thing for the loop
				from point \(II\), to point \(V\), to point \(VI\), to point \(III\), and back to point \(II\).
				From point \(II\) to point \(V\), the voltage drops by \(\left(2~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_2\).
				From point \(V\) to point \(VI\), the voltage decreases by \(7~\mathrm{V}\).
				It decreases instead of increasing across the voltage source
				because the direction of the current on our diagram is going from the positive end to the negative end.
				When the current is flowing from the negative end to the positve end then the voltage would increase.
				From point \(VI\) to point \(III\), the voltage doesn't change.
				From point \(III\) to point \(II\),
				the voltage increases by \(\left(3~\Omega\right)I_1\) and decreases by \(5~\mathrm{V}\).
				The signs of these two potential differences is opposite of what it normally would be
				because the loop we are following is opposite the direction of the current in this
				section of the circuit.
				We get the following when we sum all of this together.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}-(2~\mathrm{\Omega})I_2-7~\mathrm{V}+\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-5~\mathrm{V}=0\tag{4}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				We now have three equations—equations 2, 3, and 4—with three unknowns—\(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\)—that we can solve for. 
				First let's plug equation 2 into equation 3.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}5~\mathrm{V}-\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-\left(1~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)\left(I_1+I_2\right)=0\tag{5}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's rearrange equation 5 and equation 4 to look like the following.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}-\left(4~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-\left(1~\Omega\right)I_2+5~\mathrm{V}=0\tag{6}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-\left(2~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_2-12~\mathrm{V}=0\tag{7}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Multiply both sides of equation 6 by 2.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}-\left(8~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-\left(2~\Omega\right)I_2+10~\mathrm{V}=0\tag{6}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1-\left(2~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_2-12~\mathrm{V}=0\tag{7}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Subtract equation 7 from equation 6 and then solve for \(I_1\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}-\left(11~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)I_1+22~\mathrm{V}=0\tag{8}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I_1=2~\mathrm{A}\tag{9}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				We've determined one of our three currents that we need to calculate.
				Note that \(1~\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{\Omega}\) is equal to \(1~\mathrm{A}\).
				An \(\mathrm{A}\) is an ampere, the unit for current.
				Next plug equation 9 into equation 3, and solve for \(I_2\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}5~\mathrm{V}-\left(3~\Omega\right)\left(2~\mathrm{A}\right)-\left(1~\Omega\right)I_3=0\tag{10}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I_3=-1~\mathrm{A}\tag{11}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we know what \(I_3\) is. The value we got is negative so we know that the real direction of
				\(I_3\) is opposite to what is shown in the above diagram.
				Lastly, let's plug equations 9 and 11 into equation 2 and solve for \(I_2\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}2~\mathrm{A}+I_2=-1~\mathrm{A}\tag{12}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I_2=-3~\mathrm{A}\tag{13}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's redraw the diagram of the circuit to indicate the correct direction of the currents.
